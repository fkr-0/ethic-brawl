## Prompt

```text
Create a production-ready pixel-art sprite sheet for ETHIC BRAWL: Albert Camus.
Output EXACTLY one image arranged as a perfect 4x4 grid, 16 frames total, read left-to-right and top-to-bottom.
Every cell must be the same size, perfectly aligned, with no gutters, no margins, no border, no labels, no text.
Use true alpha transparency. Keep the same character identity, costume, palette, scale, camera angle, lighting, and pixel density in all 16 cells.
Right-facing side-view fighter poses unless a frame explicitly says left-facing recovery. Keep the full body inside every cell.
Crisp readable 2D arcade pixel art, limited palette, strong silhouette. Prioritize body pose clarity over large magical effects.

Albert Camus — The Absurdist; role: evasive counter duelist.
Biography: French-Algerian absurdist writer and moral rebel recast as a calm cigarette-lit duelist. He fights not because the universe gives meaning, but because revolt is the only honest answer to meaninglessness. His round arc moves from detached observer, to precise counter-rebel, to a quiet victory gesture that refuses melodrama.
Appearance: sharp jaw, short dark hair, tired eyes, charcoal mid-century suit, off-white shirt, loosened tie, rolled sleeves, polished shoes, thin cigarette and controlled smoke ribbons.
Palette: charcoal #24272B, off-white #E8E1D2, smoke #AEB5B8, sun gold #F6C453, void teal #00F5FF.
Animation identity: elegant dancer balance, small cigarette inhale idle, compact sidestep run, composed airborne tuck, forearm smoke-veil block.
Normals: Absurd Jab: economical lead jab, tiny smoke snap, fast interrupting poke; Rebel Backfist: half-turn backfist with smoke crescent, gray arc with void-teal edge, mid pressure and whiff punish; Sisyphus Heel: precise lateral heel or heel-drop, sun glint at heel, heavy chain finisher
Specials: B>A Absurd Revolt Wave: startup smoke gathers in palm, active low void-teal shockwave with sun rim, impact ground ribbon wave, recovery exhale recovery; B<A Rebel Reversal: startup exposed shoulder bait, active smoke crescent mirror guard, impact compact riposte flash, recovery shield dissolves; B>J Invincible Summer Dash: startup low loaded sunlit step, active thin dash with smoke afterimages, impact reappears balanced, recovery tie settles; BvJ The Absurd Domain: startup ash drops to ground, active void-teal ring expands, impact quiet sun motes orbit, recovery open-palm sustain
Appearance continuity: sharp jaw, short dark hair, tired eyes, charcoal mid-century suit, off-white shirt, loosened tie, rolled sleeves, polished shoes, thin cigarette and controlled smoke ribbons
Palette anchors: charcoal #24272B, off-white #E8E1D2, smoke #AEB5B8, sun gold #F6C453, void teal #00F5FF
Animation identity: elegant dancer balance, small cigarette inhale idle, compact sidestep run, composed airborne tuck, forearm smoke-veil block

Create EXACTLY one square RGBA sprite sheet arranged as a perfect 4x4 grid: 16 equal cells, read left-to-right and top-to-bottom.
Use at least 1024x1024 pixels and dimensions divisible by four. No gutters, margins, borders, labels, captions, numbers, UI, or scenery.
True alpha transparency only. One full-body fighter in every cell. Orthographic side-view arcade camera. Stable ground baseline.
Keep character identity, face, costume, prop, palette, scale, lighting, outline weight, and pixel density identical in all cells.
Crisp deliberate pixel art with a limited palette and readable silhouette. Do not paint intermediate blur; each cell is a clean animation drawing.
Root-lock every grounded frame: keep the pelvis/root near the same cell coordinate. Show movement through stride, compression, weight transfer,
overlap, and counter-swing. Do not move the character progressively across the sheet. The game engine supplies screen translation.
Keep feet inside the cell, keep effects compact, and never connect marks across cell boundaries.

SHEET: TAKEOFF, AIR ARC, LANDING, AND RECOVERY. Keep one consistent side-view camera and horizontal root anchor.

Frames 1-4, takeoff:
1 standing anticipation, knees and hips begin to load;
2 deepest crouch/compression, arms prepare;
3 explosive extension, toes still near baseline;
4 clean takeoff, feet visibly leave the baseline.

Frames 5-8, airborne arc:
5 rising pose with limbs trailing;
6 near apex, body longest and lightest;
7 apex transition, vertical velocity visually near zero;
8 beginning descent, limbs prepare for contact.

Frames 9-12, landing:
9 pre-contact with feet reaching for baseline;
10 first contact, clear squash and impact absorption;
11 deepest landing compression, torso and secondary cloth/hair continue downward;
12 first recovery upward, balance returning.

Frames 13-16, settle:
13 small corrective step or character-specific stabilizing gesture;
14 guard and head return to neutral height;
15 secondary motion settles;
16 exact reusable idle-ready pose.

Do not add a floor, dust cloud, or scenery. A tiny contact accent inside frame 10 is allowed but must not obscure the feet.
